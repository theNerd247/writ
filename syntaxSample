Pattern Lambdas 
================

Pattern lambdas are used to define functions that produce
similar content based on the content of some pre-existing
content. They are "templates-on-the-go".

{f = ... =>

| This is a pattern declaration. This
| extends the function's variables

## {title = lorem ipsum}

as;dfkja ;jasdf; kj;

{reasons =
  * asdf 
  * asdf 
  * asdf 
  * asdf 
}

There are {|reasons|} examples in as;dkfj;asdf

{numbered reasons}

brings us to

look at the first item in the list: {reaons.1}
}

===> 

{f = title reasons => ...}
{f $ lorem ipsum $ b[asdf, ...]}

A smaller example is: 

{f = ... => we are {attr = fun}}
{f $ jazz}
{f $ jar}
{f $ pot}

Function's Can Be Order-Called or Dict-Called
=============================================

{f = ... => ## {title = adf}\n\n {reasons = * adf; * asdf; * asdf; }}

{f $ 

this is areallllly long paragrphaa
asdf;kajf
as;dfj

$

* asdf
* asdf
* asdf

}


{f 

$reasons$

* asdf
* asdf
* asdf

$title$

this is areallllly long paragrphaa
asdf;kajf
as;dfj

}

is also valid
